# Databases_PriCoSha
PriCoSha CS-UY 3083

A.
* PriCosha is a Private Content Sharing service that allows groups the share information publicly or privately among themselves.
For the implementation of this particular project, I used Python, Flask, and MySQL. The design of the html websites are still rudimentary (simple green and grey scheme) as the focus was put more towards the funcitonality of the project (Databases). 
The file init1.py contains all the python code for this project with brief comments in between, and in the templates folder you can find the html files that were used for particular actions that the user may use. Common errors were handled gracefully.
